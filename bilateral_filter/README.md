# Bilateral filter

While reading one new Deep Learning paper I found reference to Bilateral filters and decided to look meaning of the words. And idea behind was so simple and interesting so I've spent a few days implementing Bilateral Grid and trying to use it.

Python implementation inside `bilateral_filter.py`
Exploring the method in `Explore Bilateral Filter.ipynb`

Signal Processing Approach. Sylvain Paris and Frédo Durand](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/publi/2007/siggraph/Chen_07_Bilateral_Grid.pdf) 
- Slides from Sylvain Paris were interesting for implementing grid [Fast Bilateral Filtering. Sylvain Paris](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs129/2012/lectures/bf_course_Brown_Oct2012.pdf)
- Course notes from people behind Grid idea were interesting for application [A Gentle Introduction to Bilateral Filtering and its Applications. Sylvain Paris and Frédo Durand](https://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/bf_course/course_notes.pdf)
- also I've implemented simple version of idea from this paper [Real-Time Video Abstraction paper. Winnemoller, Olsen and Gooch](http://holgerweb.net/PhD/Research/papers/videoabstraction.pdf)
