## Misc

Here I'm saving results from presentation, papers etc.

- `gaussian_mixture_model_stan` - Notebook for my presentation about Stan on example of solving Gaussian Mixture Model
- `vae` - Notebooks about exploring variational autoencoder (VAE). I've trained simple autoencoder, VAE, beta-VAE. Played with their latent space, math operation and compared results.
